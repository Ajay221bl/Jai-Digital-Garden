# organize your composition

why people don't organize their SOPs/PS?
- because it is high effort job
- people don't follow the exact instructions
- people don't plan before writing. They immediately start writing stuff
- they never really put a structure around what they have achieved

#### Important points
- identify main thesis- 
	- identify the main thread that you want to build your SOP beads on
- identify what each para is going to be about
-  link each paragraph to each other 
	- lets write about some eating things
	- suppose there are four bowls of following: strawberries, raisins, almonds, and dates
	- lets create a paragraph for each food item, ensuring that when jumping from one para to another we do it using some kind of link. It should FLOW SMOOTH.
here we go:
___strawberry is one of the tastiest fruit on the planet earth. Not just that, it also comes packed with plenty of nutrition. Kids love strawberry because of their juiciness and the after taste it leaves in the mouth. There are another fruits too that have kind of similar characteristics when it comes to imparting strong flavor to the pallet of a human. One of them is Raisins.
Now raisins are something that one would like to eat during the start of morning. These are perfect dry fruits for satisfying morning sugar cravings. A handful of raisins would not only satisfy your sugar craving but also give you sudden rush of energy because of fructose it contains. Some dry fruits are meant to be consumed with another dry fruit because it increases the flavor of the primary dry fruit. For example raisins are best paired with almonds and 80% of people who consume raisins also consume almonds with them.
Almonds are like king of dry fruits. Rich in omega 3s, Almonds are packed with tons of nutrition. People who do ketogenic diet during weight loss consume plenty of almonds in order to fulfill their fat intake. And they are loaded with fat content. But consuming so many of un-soaked almonds could result in high blood pressure. One should consider eating them only if they are soaked. But not every dry fruit tastes best when soaked. Dates are one of them.
Now dates are somewhat like raisins as they taste sweet like them but you can't eat them in many numbers. First of all, they are too dense in calories. Also, eating a piece of date could result in a sweetened pallet for longer duration compared to raisins.___
