# proofread proofread proofread
- if you don't proofread your essay, even if you spent 10 hours writing that essay, still it is going to put a bad impression on admissions committee as it is going to contain too many grammatical mistakes
- analogy- if you spent 8 hours cooking the pudding, but if you presented it in a messed up way, the guests are not going to appreciate it because of the immediate bad first impressions. It would damage your reputation

> In most cases, admissions committees don't get to meet you. They just get to meet your personal statement. Your personal statement or SOP serves as your proxy in a reputable and respectable manner

- ask the well read people to take a look at your personal statement/ SOP.
- ask them the question: `how readable is the essay ?`
- it would be better if you ask a native American who is a scholar, to evaluate your SOP/PS based on how readable it is to an American
- be objective in your evaluation and classify your SOP/Personal Statement in one of these three categories:
	1. Trauma (needs a complete rewrite)
	2. Serious injury (need to alter a few paragraphs)
	3. health checkup (need to rectify some grammatical errors)
