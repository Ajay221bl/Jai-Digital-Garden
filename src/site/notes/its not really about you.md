# Its not really about you

> a paradox indeed

-  Not a personal statement but a __"service statement"__.
- Focusing too heavily on your dreams and desires, emphasizing too markedly your resume or CV, and highlighting too blatantly your predispositions are mistakes.
- The more important question is how you're going to contribute to society, how you're going to leave this Earth better than you left and this can't be bullshit. You have to be vulnerable and highlight your human side as well. Don't exaggerate stuff. give evidence on how you have helped society previously.


##### Common dreams that people mention in their personal statement that they wanna seek (which ARE good)

- __Advancing literature__- How will you move science forward?
	- I want to explore this issue and this issue
	- I want to contribute in my own small way to this scientific field

- __Addressing modern problems__- How will you help society overcome some of its issues?
	- obesity, homelessness, access to healthcare, corruption

- __Helping the less privileged__- we all have this privilege of applying to universities. How will we assist those who don't posses it? We are lucky to be born in this well nourished environment 

- __Seeking the unknown__- Are you searching for answers?
	- somewhat similar to __advancing literature__ idea
	- being visionary. example: life in outer space, unanswered question in physics



> If they ask you about your goals in the PS/SOP and you focus more on the things that you are going to contribute to the society rather than solely focusing on your own personal development then I think it would come out better


 example:

| why do you want to become<br>a doctor? (self-focused) | why do you want to become <br>a doctor? (society- focused)                                                                                                                   |

| 4. I want to develop my skillset                      | 4. I want to advance so much in this field so that I am able to somehow donate my smallest contribution of intellect to the discovery of something that is truly life saving |

> be specific when you talk about the way you are gonna contribute to the society. touch the depth.
> - for example, when you identify some problem/ issue/ case in society always try to back it up with ___verified statistics___ 

##### why do you want to become a data scientist?
_Remember to the contribution you are going to make to the society/ science; solving a problem_
1. I want to bring the unutilized data to the data pipeline. Data that is very tough to get insights from or the data that hasn't been touched till date because of its unmanageable structure, I want to work on methods that make this type of data discernable and as a result produces benefits to the parts of society that haven't been exposed to this kind of data revolution.
2. Data has not yet revolutionized the rural areas. I believe that bringing the power of data to the masses that reside in the backward part of India, would help in better diagnostics of health of mal-nutritioned people
3. To progress the AI boom further, it could only be possible by making the untouched data available as a training dataset to the models, so that AI could get a full grasp of what humans really are underneath. To do that. To do that novel ways of gathering and storing data are required that I want to explore through this degree.
4. Food industry in India is still lacking when it comes to utilizing AI in the manufacturing units. Though it would be a big mouth , but I want to bring the power of data science in India's food sector so that the efficiency of the factories increases.

> don't just talk about helping society. You should talk about the benefits that you would have while pursuing this degree. MAKE A BALANCE
