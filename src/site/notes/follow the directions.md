# follow the directions

if you don't follow the directions, if you don't do what is asked then it sends the wrong message to the admission committee

examples:
#### Q. Why do you want to be a data scientist?
actual meaning: what are the reasons ??
lets try giving 4- 5 reasons

1. I want to help solve complex problems by working with data.
2. My curiosity about data world could be sensed from the fact that I wrote an article about how big data is revolutionizing the food industry.
3. I strongly believe that more and more data will be available in future as more people get connected to the internet and use data driven platforms. I think equipping myself with the necessary skills related to data would let me contribute to the world in a meaningful manner.
4. I particularly want to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the field of robotics and figure out a way to draw meaningful insights even from a limited amount of data using various techniques

example of some other reasons:
- quite closely related to my previous field
- I already have the required skillset
- It would help me expand my horizons as I can use my data skills to many domains.


#### Q Essay must be typed, double spaced, and a maximum of three pages. Discuss your career plans and goals, the influence or your work and school experience on them, and why it is important for you to undertake this graduate program at this time.
actual meaning:
-  where do you see yourself in 5 to 10 years from now and how would this program help you achieve that
- the goals that you have in mind, how your past school experience and work experience have helped you to progress towards that goal.
	- the answer would go something like this:
		- > ___so I see myself as a data scientist who is working in an AI lab solving data driven problems and contributing to the data domain in a meaningful manner. I always had the curiosity in to explore the data world. The article that I wrote in the magazine was a stepping stone in broadening my knowledge horizons of the data world. Not only I learnt about why collecting huge amounts of data is important but also its applications in diverse fields. I feel the need to pursue this particular program at this point because I think a really structured curriculum along with invaluable mentorship of professors would help me hone the skills required to become a data scientist. I already have completed python programming MOOC from Helsinki university and to gain in depth knowledge about data driven methods, I feel this course would be the best. The need to convert world's data to insights is becoming urgent with every passing day and the earlier one starts contributing to the society using data, the sooner we would be able to solve the most demanding problems in  a systematic manner.___

#### Q Please upload a statement of 500-1000 words explaining why you are applying to Yale for graduate study. Describe your research interests and preparation for your intended fields of study, including prior research and other relevant experiences. Relate how the faculty, research, and resources at Yale would contribute to your future goals.
actual meaning:
- how Yale is a match for your future goals
	- for example, if you want to do a masters in AI, mention about the research conducted at one of the AI lab at Yale and how it aligns with your past experience and future endeavors. 
	- Get into the specifics of the research that is being conducted at Yale university.
	- find out about how Yale and only YALE could help you achieve that future goal
	- > The key here is to do extensive research on the program and Yale faculty and department so that you are convinced that your goals can ONLY be fulfilled sufficiently if you attend Yale university.
