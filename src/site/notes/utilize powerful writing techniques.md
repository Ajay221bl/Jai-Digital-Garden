# Utilize powerful writing techniques

#### Beginning of SOP/PS
- start the SOP/PS by hammering the idea that you really want to get through to the admissions committee.
	- use repetition to really hammer in the idea during the first few sentences of your SOP.
	- Later on, throughout the SOP, you get to this idea from time to time by supporting it through your past achievements, your goals that are aligned with this vision/idea.
	- hammering the main idea in first few sentences sets up the reader on how the organization of the essay is going to look like
- Use simple vocabulary as it hits hard.
	- it really helps in conveying the message in its purest form
	- it helps appeal to the emotional side of people.
		- imagine if politicians had a complex way of articulating their speeches (using tough vocabulary), they wouldn't have gained much following.
		- > Ideas conveyed by stripping down the fluff struck harder.
- The starting sentences should have shorter length because they hit harder.
